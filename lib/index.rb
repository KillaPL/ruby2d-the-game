# LOOK CAREFULLY AT TENSORFLOW

# Look into neural networks to implement AI, what person wants to do ans so on

# LET THE SYSTEM USE SYSTEMS ARIAL BY DEFAULT?
# LET THE SYSTEM SHOW WHAT FONTS ARE AVAILABLE?

# RENDER WHAT PERSON HAS IN RIGHT AND LEFT HAND?
# ANIMATION WHEN THOSE TOOLS ARE USED? LIKE CHOPPING WOOD?
# ONLY ALLOW HAVING LEFT HAND AND RIGHT HAND FOR NOW

# ONLY RENDERING METHODS SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH PIXELS PER SQUARE
# REST SHOULD ONLY HANDLE ABOUT IN-GAME POSITION

# SET GLOBAL VARIABLES WITH $!
# BUG, CHARACTER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FINISH ON TREE
# BUG, IF STEP IS TRIED INTO IMPOSSIBLE PLACE, GAME HANGS
