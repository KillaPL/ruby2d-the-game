# The Game

## Description

This is an implementation of a game based on [ruby2d](http://www.ruby2d.com/). In simplest way of explanation, I am trying to create something like [dwarf fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), with a couple of main game modes in mind:
  - simulation, where player/observer doesn't do anything, just witnesses how the city grows
  - city building, where player is allowed to interact with the world similarily to dwarf fortress
  - single character, where player would have full controll over one character. Something like the sims / dwarf fortress adventurer mode.
